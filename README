New version Tensorflow only (without Keras API)

Scripts available in the archive
================================

1. img_reconst_TF.py
- This script performs image reconstruction from the response of a white noise 
  image at all layers of the network (the script loops on all convolutional 
  layers). 
- The target image is elephant.jpg
- Two optimization methods are implemented: gradient descent and BFGS
- To run the script in background turn show_pictures to 0 

       > python3 img_reconst_TF.py

2. style_reconst_TF.py
- This script performs style reconstruction from the response of a white noise 
  image at all layers of the network (the script loops on all convolutional 
  layers). 
- The style image is vangogh.jpg
- Only BFGS is implemented
- To run the script in background turn show_pictures to 0 

       > python3 style_reconst_TF.py

3. style_transfer_TF.py
- This script performs style transfer from the style image is vangogh.jpg
  to the content image elephant.jpg.
- The content loss is computed at layer Block4 Conv2. The script can be 
  configured to synthesize pictures with content loss computed on all layers 
  (uncomment the content_layers line)
- The picture is synthesized with alpha=1e-6. Modify alpha_list to loop on 
  different values 
- Only BFGS is implemented
- To run the script in background turn show_pictures to 0 

       > python3 style_transfer_TF.py

4. utils.py
- Image processing library
